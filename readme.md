# Full Stack Learning

This repository contains the work from the Udemy course I'm working through as part of learning full stack development.

## Branches

### MAIN
- All progress will be pushed to this branch, including lessons, challenges and capstones

### MY-PORTFOLIO-V1
- First branch used to test out GitHub Pages and host the initial Portfolio project based on Section 4 Lesson 28 - Portfolio Project challenge
- Cycled out 2025-07-07 in favour of the Personal Website

### PERSONAL-WEBSITE
- This is my personal website to be the primary one hosted in GitHub Pages unless required temporarily as part of the Udemy course
- Will be updated as I learn new skills
- Forked from the 4.X Capstone directory from Main - the original directory and its contents *will not be updated after I've moved on to S5+, so all updates be be applied directly to the Personal Website branch

## Info
- Future progress will go into appropriate branches to get merged into MAIN at some point, but while things are moving quickly I'm going to just deal with Main directly for the time being
