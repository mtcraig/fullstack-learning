# Full Stack Learning

This repository contains the work from the Udemy course I'm working through as part of learning full stack development.

## Branches

### MAIN
- All progress will be pushed to this branch, including lessons, challenges and capstones

### MY-PORTFOLIO-V1
- This branch is the currently active branch for GitHub Pages and hosts the initial Portfolio project based on Section 4 Lesson 28 - Portfolio Project challenge
- I'll cycle the GitHub page branch as appropriate as I progress and update this description accordingly

## Info
- Future progress will go into appropriate branches to get merged into MAIN at some point, but while things are moving quickly I'm going to just deal with Main for the time being
