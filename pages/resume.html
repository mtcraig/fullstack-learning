My role involved completion of development, ongoing running and process maintenance as requirements were refined between the process MVP and the succeeding Strategic solution, deliver updating cohorts weekly to reduce Overdraft limits in a risk managed rollout across the customer base, including multiple Pilots and a phased MVP solution.
